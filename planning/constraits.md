# Constraints

## 1. Time

 Our project has a fixed timeline of 6 weeks, starting on March 12, 2023, and ending on April 24, 2023. This means that we need to prioritize our tasks and work efficiently to meet our deadlines.


## 2. Technical

 Our project is limited by the technical skills and knowledge of our team members. We need to ensure that we are using the appropriate technologies and tools that we are comfortable with to build the app.

## 4. Quality

We need to ensure that the app is of high quality, is free of bugs, and is tested thoroughly before the delivery date. This means that we need to allocate time for testing and debugging during the development process.

## 5. Resource

Our team has limited resources, including time and manpower. We need to optimize our resources to achieve the best results within the given constraints.

## 6. Compatibility

It is important to note that our project requires compatibility with different operating systems including Linux, MacOS, and Windows. However, we should be aware that there may be some bugs or issues that occur when using npm packages and different versions of Node.js and Ionic frameworks across these operating systems. It is crucial that team members pay attention to the specific versions of these tools and frameworks that we use to ensure compatibility and minimize the risk of errors or bugs. Regular communication and updates among team members regarding any issues or changes to these versions can help prevent any unexpected problems and ensure a smooth development process.
