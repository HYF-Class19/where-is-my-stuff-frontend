# HOW TO PLAN: Where's My Stuff

## 1. Brainstorming

Brainstorming is the process of generating ideas and solutions for a problem or project. In the context of the "Where's My Stuff" project, brainstorming could involve identifying the key features and functionality of the app, as well as potential challenges and roadblocks. To conduct a brainstorming session:

- We gathered as a team members on last Sunday and we must at least once in week days gathers to share idea.
- We set  clear goal on last Sunday session and we identified key app features but we did not discuss on details.
- I also want to encourage everyone to share their ideas and thoughts.
- It is important to use a WhiteBoard  or sticky notes to record and organize the ideas generated, in this case I recommend anyone to use this Google drive which I am sharing the Google Drive with everyone to record the notes, the notes will be in this [Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1n4xAEPq0uNc7XVgn6ZWWloANV89NJ89Z) which is in the Google Drive, and contain this list of notes:

  - [Google Docs here you will type the ideas](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_uEhXpUu9z-kH_DbQbucF8zlobxXiYVlFh3uVrP9PJ0/edit)
  - [Google Drawings here you wil draw the idea](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1hEAlZXwJr9wyu0bdnhIWCaoQRcwKKvByHyLjOwFbHU0/edit)
  - [Google Jamboard here you will visualize your idea is also sort of drawing](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1WnYwla-MngIi6IZGiDqcQF_IRoNE8fIqprEbP-R_NKk/viewer)
  
- We have to review the ideas and determine which are most relevant and feasible for our project.
  
## 2. Prioritizing

Once we have a list of ideas and features for the app, it's important to prioritize them based on their importance and feasibility. To prioritize:

- We will review the list of ideas and features and determine which are most essential for the App functionality.
- We have to consider any constraints or limitations that may affect which features can be developed within the project timeline and technical capability.
- We have to prioritize the features based on importance, feasibility, and impact on the user experience.

## 3. User Story Dependencies

User stories are a way of describing the APP functionality from the user's perspective. To identify user story dependencies:

- We will review the list of prioritized features and identify which features depend on other features being developed first.
- We have to create a diagram or flowchart to visualize the dependencies and order of development.
- We have to use the user story dependencies to inform the order in which features are developed.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance criteria are a set of requirements that must be met for a feature or user story to be considered complete. To define acceptance criteria:

- We have to review each user story and feature and identify the specific requirements and goals.
- We have to determine the criteria that must be met for the feature to be considered complete and functional.
- We have to write out the acceptance criteria in a clear and concise manner.

## 5. Defining Tasks

Tasks are the specific actions that must be taken to develop and implement each feature or user story. To define tasks:

- We will review the user story and acceptance criteria for each feature and then we have to break it down into smaller, specific tasks.
- As a team leader I will assign each task to a team member and set a deadline for completion.
- As a team leader I will Track the progress of each task and update the project board accordingly.
  
## 6. Project Board

A project board is a visual tool for tracking the progress of tasks and milestones in a project. I already created the project board and milestone and the task will be divide it after our meeting.

[project board](https://github.com/orgs/HYF-Class19/projects/36)

- I created a board for the "Where's My Stuff__frontend" project and i organize it into categories, as "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done." 
- I will add each task to the appropriate category and will assign it to a team member after meeting as well 
- I will be updating the project board regularly to reflect the progress of each task and milestone.
